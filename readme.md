# WebGL-Drawing-Canvas
This project allows a user to interact with a WebGL drawing canvas. It was completed for my intro to computer graphics class.

## Setup and Info
Open up "index.html" to view and interact with the program

There are two modes - file mode, and drawing mode

## File Mode
You can upload a file from the `dat files` folder and the program will render the picture.

- Enter file mode by pressing 'f'
- Cycle between colors by pressing 'c'

## Drawing Mode
You can draw lines on the canvas

- Enter drawing mode by pressing 'd'
- Click to draw a new point, and each additional click will draw a line
- Hold 'b' and click to start a new line
- Cycle between colors by pressing 'c'
